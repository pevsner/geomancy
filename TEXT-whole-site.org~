** Geomancy & Feng Shui
  This site explains Chinese Geomancy called Feng Shui. 
It covers the basic theory, touches on advanced metaphysics and includes practical suggestions. 
** Introduction 
Geomancy, or 'Earth Divination', is the reading of energetic interactions on the Earth.

 Geo   = Earth   
 Mancy   = Divination / reading  

Most ancient cultures ( for instance: Aboriginal, African, American Indian, Druid, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Indian, Nordic, Mayan etc.) have or had their own
systems of explanation.

Feng Shui, the Chinese Taoist form of Geomancy, provides the most
comprehensive and well documented type			
*** Feng Shui General
Taoism (there is actually no such thing) came from the thoughts and
writings of 'Lao Tzu' who most famously wrote the 'Tao te ching'. His insight
into the working of the cosmos, and how best to live in harmony with it,
formed the philosophical basis of all Taoist practices. (martial arts like Tai
Qi Chuan and Qi Gong, Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal remedies) and
Internal Alchemy). 

Feng Shui was a later practice derived to harmonise living environments.				

Qi (energy), its creation, qualities and interactions is key.

There are a number of Schools of Feng Shui including: The Form School, The
Compass School, The Black Sect School, The Flying Star School & The
Classical School. 
The Classical School combines theory of various Schools, primarily the
'Form' and 'Compass' Schools, and is what I cover on this site.

In short it breaks down to: 
1.Form: How the topography of the surroundings and the shape of the
 building affects the quality and flow of energy(Qi)
2.Compass orientation: How direction of flow affects energy(Qi).
3.Reading of the above interactions, referencing portents derived from
 'The Five Element' cycle.
4.Personal Horosccope: Can be included to fine tune a consultation.
