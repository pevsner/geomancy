  <h2>Geomancy</h2>
  <p>Feng Shui explained</p>
  <hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Geomancy is the reading of energetic interactions on earth and how they affect us. (geo=earth,
   mancy=divination or reading).
   Most ancient cultures (Aboriginal, African, American Indian, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Indian,
   Nordic, Mayan etc.) have their own systems of explanation.
   Feng Shui, the Chinese Taoist form of Geomancy, provides one of the most comprehensive and well
   documented explanations.

       <h2>Taoism</h2>
<img class="center" src="imgs/qi.jpg">
<p class="quote" >       
" The way that can be spoken of 
is not the constant way. 
<br>
The name that can be named 
is not the constant name. 
<br>
The nameless was the beginning 
of heaven and earth. 
<br>
The named was the mother 
of the myriad creatures. " 
<br>
<br>
<b>Lao Tzu<br> "Tao Te Ching"</b>
</p>
<p>
Taoism is a name, for a way of being not a religion (see the quote).
It is thought to originate from the actions and writings (under duress) of  Lao Tzu. 
The classic Taoist text the <b>"Tao Te Ching"</b> written by <b>Lao Tzu</b>, sometime between 6 BC and 3 BC, is
poetic in style but sublimely concise, containing many layers of detailed insight. Lao Tzus' later
work, the <b>"Hua Hua Ching"</b>, contains more specific information on energetic interactions.
(see reading list for details).
Lao Tzu realised that everything was connected, the planets, the elements and all the living things.
He deduced that there were common elemental forces and attributes that link everything in the cosmos.
<br>
<br>
By connecting to these forces through Meditation and Taoist practices (such as <b>Qi Gong</b>, <b>Tai Qi</b>
Chuan and Internal Alchemy) one is able to increase physical and subtle energy levels and build a
strong platform for spiritual development. Simplistically it is like connecting the positive
(heaven) and negative (earth) electric leads to give power. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Grounding</b> and rootedness to the earth is the <b>launch pad</b> to the spiritual.
The more grounded you become the subtler the energies you experience.
The subtler the energies you absorb, the stronger you become. Spiritual development is a natural
outcome. Nothing is forced because you have a firm foundation. 
</p>

<h2></a>Feng Shui - general</h2>
<p>The Taoists explained energetic interactions with a  system derived from their knowledge of
  creation. The theory underlying Feng Shui is the same for all Taoist practices including the
  Martial arts (Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, etc.), Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal remedies etc.)
  and Internal Alchemy.The concept of Qi (energy) its creation, varied qualities and interactions is key.
  There are a number of different Schools (approaches) of Feng Shui (Form School, Compass School,
  Black Sect School, Flying Star School Classical School). The Classical School is an amalgam of
  traditional theories and this is explained here.</p>

<a id="theory">
<h2><a name="definition"></a>Feng Shui - definition</h2>
<p><b>Feng</b>is Qi (energy) that flows above the ground and occupies every space there is, it flows
  as wind, and is fast moving. It's characteristics are dependent upon the direction in which it
  flows and the environment it occupies. It can be partially described as electromagnetically
  charged particles in the atmosphere.</p>
<p><font color="#66ccff"><b>Shui</b></font></p>
<p>is Qi (energy) that is contained within the earth and is inherent in
the structure of a building (all mass), it is slow moving. Shui can be
experienced as a cool blue energy, hence being called water, it is
essentially gravitational force.</p>
<br>
<p>The practice of Feng Shui aims to balance these energies
to benefit the occupant/s. It is a system of assessing the quality of
energies at play and calculating how they interact.(Yang) above<br>

<br>
<hr>
<h2>Feng Shui - application</h2>
<p>A magnetic compass (Lo Pan) is used to determine
site/space orientation, the relevant energies at play and how
they interact. Qi (energy) has different characteristics dependant upon
  direction.
  <br>
  ( please refer to the <a href="8 directions.html">8 Directions</a> section of this site for
  details).
<br>
Assessment is based on orientation, personal reading and other general observations which are
outlined below.</p>

<h1> 5 Elements</h1>
<img class="center" alt="cycle" src="imgs/cycle_simple.jpg">
<p class="pcenter">5 Element Cycle</p>
<p>The 5 Elements describe the main
types of energy (Taoists identified) in the physical world. Everything in the physical world
(visible or invisible - including air, electromagnetic fields etc.) has
the overall characteristic of one of the Elements. Understanding their qualities and
  the way they interact helps us to implement Feng Shui.
</p>

<h2><a name="Origin"></a>Origin</h2>
<p>
  Chinese Taoists discovered a supreme natural power which they called "Wu Qi". Wu Qi means
  nothingness. All things in the spiritual realm are unified,
  all things in the physical world are dualities. There have been various cross-over theories to
  explain this Original force in Scientific speak. One theory is that the "nothingness"& is what
  Physicists describe as "Dark Matter" or subtle sub atomic entities. Dark Matter makes up the
  majority of the universe accounting for approximately 90%, with the remaining 10% being the
  physical universe or what we see as physical (planets, atmosphere, people,stuff). Please see the
  <a href="advanced.html">"advanced"</a> section for more detail. The diagram opposite shows the
  transformation of energy from subtle to physical. It explains everything. From unity (Wu Qi),
  splitting into (Yin and Yang(duality)) and then (dependent on the quality and proportions) forming
  the variety of our world (5 Elements to 64 hexagrams and beyond).

<h2>Yin & Yang to 5 elements</h2>
<img class="center" title="subtle origin" src="imgs/origin.jpg" alt="subtle origin">
<p>The Chinese used a binary system to describe the quality of energy.Yang is (+'ve, male) is a Yin
  (-'ve, female) is a broken line.(please refer to the Yang section for an explanation). Man is a
  model of the integration of Yin and Yang. Physical energy is manifested as the body and subtle
  energy manifested as the mind and spirit.
