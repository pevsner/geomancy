Most ancient cultures ( for instance: Aboriginal, African, American Indian, Druid, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Indian, Nordic, Mayan etc.) have or had their own systems of explanation.
<br><br>
Feng Shui, the Chinese Taoist form of Geomancy, provides the most comprehensive and well documented type.

    <p>
      The theory underpinning Feng Shui is the same for all Taoist practices. [including; Martial arts (Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, etc.), Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal remedies etc.) and Internal Alchemy].
      </p>
  <div class="column1"> 
    <p>Taoism came from the thoughts and writings of 'Lao Tzu' who most famously wrote the  'Tao te ching'. His insight into the working of the cosmos, and how best to live in harmony with it, formed the basis of all Taoist practices. (martial arts like Tai Qi Chuan and Qi Gong, Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal remedies) and Internal Alchemy). Feng Shui was later developed as a way to balance living environments.  
    </p>
      <p>
Qi (energy), its creation, qualities and interactions is key.
<br/>
<i>Nb. Qi is a generic name for all energy types</i>
      </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of Schools of Feng Shui including: The Form School, The Compass School, The Black Sect School, The Flying Star School & The Classical School.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The <strong>Classical School</strong> combines theory of various Schools, primarily the 'Form' and 'Compass' Schools, and is what I cover on this site.
    <ul>
      In short it breaks down to:
      <li><strong>Form:</strong> How the topography of the surroundings and the shape of the building affects the quality and flow of energy(Qi)</li>
      <li><strong>Compass orientation:</strong> How direction of flow affects energy(Qi).</li>
      <li><strong>Reading</strong> of the above interactions, referencing portents derived from 'The Five Element' cycle.Suggestions for external and internal planning, placement of furniture, color usage and more detailed changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Horoscope:</strong> This can be included as another level of detail to fine tune a consultation.

<!-- ##### FENG SHUI DEFINITION ##### -->

<div class="row">
    <h2>Feng Shui - definition</h2>
			</-- TEXT RIGHT --/>
  <div class="column1"> 
    <p>
      <strong>Feng (wind)</strong> is an invisible fast moving energy (Qi) flowing, like wind, above the ground and filling every space there is.
      <br/> 
      Imagine 'Feng' as electromagnetically charged particles in the atmosphere.
      Its characteristics are dependent upon direction of flow.
</p>
<strong>Shui (water)</strong> is an invisible energy/force inherent in physical things (mass). It is found within the Earth and is also present within the structure of buildings and all physical things. <i>Its influence is dependant on scale.</i>

Imagine 'Shui' as thick viscous invisible energy moving very slowly within the Earth. It can partly be described as a gravitational force.   
<br/><br/>
<strong>The Art of Feng Shui</strong> aims to balance and maximize the potential of these subtle energies to benefit occupants.
<br/> 
By observing the types of energy present, interactions can be calculated and advise on planning and decor given.
    </p>
<p>Taoists identified 5 general types of energy (Qi) called the <strong>five elements</strong>. How these energies interact is explained using the 'five element cycle' which is explained diagramically. This is the basis of all calculations in Feng Shui.

      A Magnetic Compass ( <b>Lo Pan</b> ) is used to determine the site, key feature and room orientations. The Compass includes information on the quality of energy and interractions. Qi (energy) characteristics vary by direction.
( please refer to the 8 Directions section of this site for details).

A full assessment is based on orientation, a personal reading  and other general observations which are outlined below.

      The <b>'Lo Pan'</b>, a magnetic Compass, is used to assess both the location in the landscape  and the building itself. The 'Lo Pan' includes information on the quality, interactions and portents (predicted effect) of energy (Qi), by direction.

    <h2>Assessment</h2>
    <p>An assessment of the site begins outside (macro) and works inwards (micro). 
      The site setting, larger external environment, is considered first. Then the internal flow of qi supplying rooms (corridors, passages and stairwell).
Finally the spaces within rooms are calculated for fine tuning (eg. to assist in furniture layout).

  <h2>Key Aims</h2>
  <div class="column"> 
    <p>
      <ul>
	<li>To determine the <strong>best location and building</strong>.</li>
	<li>Ensure an <strong>ample supply of good Qi</strong> into the property/space and a natural flow throughout.</li>
	  <li>To <strong>balance</strong> a building to suit occupants and maximize potential.</li>
	<li><strong>Position and orientate</strong> furniture, objects, working, living, sleeping areas favourably (using portents derived from Baguas).</li>
	<li><strong>Counteract malign influences.</strong></li>
      </ul>
<ul>
This can involve:
<br>
  <li>Using colour to manipulate the energy of rooms/spaces favourably, (using the 5 element cycle).</li>
  <li>Changing locations and orientation of doors / windows to affect the main energy and its exchange of a building/space.</li>
</ul>

  <!-- ##### SYMBOLISM & MYTHOLOGY ##### --> 
  
<div class="row">
  <h2>Symbolism and Mythology</h2>
  <div class="column"> 
    <p>
      A note on demystifying the jargon.
      <br>
      <br>
Symbolism and mythology are a good way of condensing large amounts of information into an understandable form.
<br>
Taoism uses symbols to describe specific energy types, however it also uses a lot of mythological creatures.  
<br/>
'Taking things literally' can lead to misinterpretation.
<br>
<br>
<i>An example:</i>
<br>
<i>
The <b>Green Dragon</b> is a great mythological figure in traditional Chinese culture  and is the symbol of the Emperor.
<br>
The Green Dragon is the symbol of fertility and male vigour and also represents the East, the Wood element and the eastern side of a building. The Green Dragon has the same attributes as the element Wood. (explained later in the  5 element section of this site).
<br>
The Green Dragon is the source of rain,  water is his life blood and he breathes fire (Water feeds Wood (the dragon) and creates Fire).
<br>
This interaction relates to what is known as <b>'The Eastern Life'</b> or the directions and elements on the Eastern Generative Cycle (water, wood, small wood and fire - N,E,SE,S). <b>The 'Western Life'</b> directions are NE,SW,W & NW and this is symbolised by the White Tiger. You may have heard of the Dragon and Tiger (left and right) side of a building and Dragon and Tiger shaped hill formations.

      <i>
Everything is connected, the planets, the elements and all the living things.
What we experience externally reflects our internal universe. Hence our environment is a reflection of ourselves and vice versa. Balancing the external environment has a direct effect upon our internal condition and helps us to realize our potential.
