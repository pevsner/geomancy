      The theory underpinning Feng Shui is the same for all Taoist practices. [including; Martial arts (Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, etc.), Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal remedies etc.) and Internal Alchemy].
      </p>
      <p>
Qi (as an invisable force), its creation, qualities and interactions is key.
      </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of Schools of Feng Shui including: The Form School, The Compass School, The Black Sect School, The Flying Star School & The Classical School.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The <strong>Classical School</strong> combines theory of various Schools, primarily the 'Form' and 'Compass' Schools, and is what I cover on this site.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It boils down to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Form:</strong> How the shape of the environment affects the quality of energy(Qi)</li>
      <li><strong>Compass orientation:</strong> How direction of flow affects energy(Qi).</li>
      <li><strong>Reading</strong> of the above interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Horosccope:</strong> Can be included to fine tune a consultation.

    <p>
      <strong>Feng (wind)</strong> is an invisible fast moving energy (Qi) flowing, like wind, above the ground and filling every space.
      <br/> 
      Imagine 'Feng' as electromagnetically charged particles in the atmosphere.
      Its characteristics are dependent upon direction of flow.
</p>
<br/><br/>
<strong>Shui (water)</strong> is an invisible energy/force inherent in physical things (mass). It is found within the Earth and is also present within the structure of buildings and all physical things. <i>Its influence is dependant on scale</i>
<br/>
Imagine 'Shui' as thick viscous invisible energy moving very slowly within the Earth. It can partly be described as a gravitational force.   
<br/><br/>
<strong>The Art of Feng Shui</strong> aims to balance these subtle energies to benefit occupants.
<br/> 
By observing the types of energy present, interactions can be calculated and advise on planning and decor given.
    </p>
<p> Taoists identified 5 general types of energy (Qi) called the <strong>five elements</strong>. Their qualities and interactions (according to the five element cycle) are the basis of all calculations in Feng Shui.

    <h2>Application</h2>
			</-- TEXT RIGHT --/>
  <div class="left_column"> 
    <p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      A Magnetic Compass ( <b>Lo Pan</b> ) is used to determine the site, key feature and room orientations. The Compass includes information on the quality of energy and interractions. Qi (energy) characteristics vary by direction.
( please refer to the 8 Directions section of this site for details).

A full assessment is based on orientation, a personal reading  and other general observations which are outlined below. 
=======
      The <b>'Lo Pan'</b>, a magnetic Compass, is used to assess both the location in the landscape  and the building itself. The 'Lo Pan' includes information on the quality, interactions and portents (predicted effect) of energy (Qi), by direction. 
(please refer to the 8 Directions section of this site for details).
<br>
<br>
A full assessment is based on orientation, topography and a personal reading together with other general observations.

    <p>An assessment of the site begins outside and works inwards. 
The macro (larger outside) environment is considered first and then the micro (small interior) for fine tuning.

    <p>
      To determine the <strong>best location and building</strong> for individuals. To <strong>balance</strong> a property to suit the occupants, <strong>maximizing potential</strong>.

Ensure an <strong>ample supply of good Qi</strong> into the property/space and a <strong>natural flow</strong> throughout. <strong>Counteract malign influences</strong>.
<br><br>
<strong>Position and orientate</strong> furniture, objects, working, living, sleeping areas favourably (using portents derived from Baguas).
<br><br>
Using colour to manipulate the energy of rooms/spaces favourably, (using the 5 element cycle).
<br><br>
Changing locations and orientation of doors / windows to affect the main energy and its exchange of   a building / space.

    <h2>Mythology</h2>
  <div class="column"> 
    <p>
All ancient traditions use metaphors and myth in explanation.
An over emphasis on 'taking things literally' can lead to misinterpretation.
<br><br>
Myth and symbology are an excellent way of condensing a large amount of information into a usable form. After all, the point of knowledge is to integrate it into your being.
<br><br>

<i>An example:</i>
<br>
The <b>Green Dragon</b> is a great mythological figure in traditional Chinese culture  and is the symbol of the Emperor.
<br>
The Green Dragon is the symbol of fertility and male vigour and also represents the East, the Wood element and the eastern side of a building. The Green Dragon has the same attributes as the element Wood. (explained later in the  5 element section of this site).
<br>
The Green Dragon is the source of rain,  water is his life blood and he breathes fire (Water feeds Wood (the dragon) and creates Fire).
<br>
This interaction relates to what is known as <b>'The Eastern Life'</b> or the directions and elements on the Eastern Generative Cycle (water, wood, small wood and fire - N,E,SE,S). <b>The 'Western Life'</b> directions are NE,SW,W & NW and this is symbolised by the White Tiger. You may have heard of the Dragon and Tiger (left and right) side of a building and Dragon and Tiger shaped hill formations.

Everything is connected, the planets, the elements and all the living things.
What we experience externally reflects our internal universe. Hence our environment is a reflection of ourselves and vice versa. Balancing the external environment has a direct effect upon our internal condition and helps us to realize our potential.
