  <h2>The 8 Directions</h2>
  <p>
    The Chinese discovered that Qi (energy) had differing characteristics depending upon the
    direction of movement. They derived a system of reading these energetic interactions using the
    main Elements.A magnetic compass (Lo Pan) is used to obtain information on orientation and
    qualities of energy.  It is a normal magnetic compass with additional markings to indicate the
    8 directions, former and later heavenly sequences, further elemental subdivisions, portents of
    spaces, water dragon information and more.

  <h2>The Baguas</h2>
  <p>
    Bagua (also known as Pakua) is the Chinese for 8 directions.
<br>
    The 8 main directions (energy types) are illustrated opposite.
    The 8 directions each have characteristics of the 5 elements. Some directions whilst being of the
    same element actually had distinguishing characteristics. Hence SW and NE whilst both being of
    the earth element differed markedly in quality. So to with W & NW (metal) and E & SE (wood).
    Such directions were named BIG and SMALL accordingly.
<br>
<br>
<i>NB.The eight main directions are the most commonly used, however there are further
    subdivisions (down to 2 degrees) which can give a more detailed divination - for specific
    work (desk) and furniture positioning and the calculation of the "Water Dragon"
    (orientation of external water flows in relation to a building).</i>
<br>
<br>

Heavenly Bagua. The inner Trigrams relate to the "Former Heavenly Sequence". A system derived to
explain the energy of free flowing Feng. Earthly Bagua. The outer Trigrams relate to the "Later
Heavenly Sequence". A system derived to explain the exchange of energy within a building/space.
Essentially the earth energy (Shui) component  inherent in the structure or gravitational
effect . The Heavenly Bagua is moveable and the Earthly Bagua is fixed. Correctly combining and
reading these two Bagua's gives the portent of a particular space.
<br>
<br>
<i>NB. The Chinese always show fire (south) at the top because it relates to the heavens(S, fire,
    yang) above and the earth(N, water, yin) below.</i>

<h2>Lo Shu ( Magic Square)</h2>
<p>
Lo Shu is a numeric magic square which said to have been found as markings the back of a Turtle.
It ties in the 8 directions and seasonal changes and relates to personal horoscope numbers.
(see horoscope section to calculate your own personal number).
<br>
<br>
Odd and even numbers alternate in the periphery of the square, the four corners are even numbers,
and the 5 odd numbers form a cross in the centre. Each line (vertical, horizontal and diagonal)
add up to 15, which is the number of days in each of the 24 cycles of the Chinese solar year.
<br>
<br>
I have indicated how the seasons tie in as well as how the amount of Yin and Yang varies. Maximum
Yin during winter, increasing Yang and decreasing Yin to mid summer and vice versa.

<h2>Readings</h2>
<p>
To establish the overall characteristic of Qi ( energy ) within a building or space, take a
magnetic compass reading at the main door opening (from the door facing outwards from the room,
it is the flow of energy into the room that we are interested in).
<br>
<br>
Whilst each space contains all of the five element energies - the entry point (door position)
is key to determining what element has the most influence.
<br>
<br>
<i>E.g.. Qi flowing into a room facing south has the general characteristic of the fire element. 
  The two Bagua's (Earthly and Heavenly) give insight into the properties and interactions of energy
  by direction.</i>

 <i> E.g.. A south facing house (door to south) has predominantly Fire Qi (energy) entering it, so
  the interaction to an eastward wall space ( middle of East side) would give us an exchange of
  wood (east) with fire (south) - wood feeds fire - hence the portent would be very beneficial
  (as you can see above and in the diagram, a portent "C" or creates Qi). The energetic activity
  in that space is very generative. This example is one of the most simple examples, the others are
  more complex. A full reading is made by overlaying the former and later heavenly sequences.
  Combining the two trigrams (3 lines) gives a hexagram (6 lines) which describes the energetic
  properties of a space.</i>
<br>

8 X 8 = 64 hexagrams which relate to the 64 hexagrams of the "I Ching".
