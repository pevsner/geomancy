  <h1>Feng Shui & Geomancy</h1>
<p>This site explains Taoist Classical Geomancy or Feng Shui.
  <br>
  It covers the basic theory</b>, insight into more advanced metaphysics and includes practical design suggestions. 
  <br/>
</p>
<hr/>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  Geomancy is the reading of energetic interactions on earth and how they affect us.
  <br/>
<b>Geo</b> = earth,
  <br/>
  <b>Mancy</b> = divination or reading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most ancient cultures had systems, some more sophisticated than others, and a few make some sense today.
  <br/>
<i>Aboriginal, African, Indian, Mayan, Egyptian, Norse, Native N. American and the Chinese, etc.</i> 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Feng Shui</b>, the Chinese Taoist form of Geomancy, provides one of the most comprehensive and well documented explanations. It is a very logical system. There's no magic or faith involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
<i>FOOTNOTE:
Everything is connected, the planets, the elements and all the living things. What we experience externally reflects our internal universe. Hence our environment is a reflection of ourselves and vice versa. Balancing the external environment has a direct effect upon our internal condition and helps us to realise our potential.</i> 
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Feng Shui - General</h2>
<p>
Nb. Terms hence referred to:
 <br/>
 <b>Qi </b>  = General Energy
 <br/>
 <b>Feng </b>= Wind  : energy in the atmosphere, particles.
 <br/>
 <b>Shui </b>= Water : energy in ground, mass, gravity affected. 
</p> 
<p>
  The Chinese <b>Taoists</b> explained energetic interactions, upon and with the environment, based on their knowledge and explanation of creation.
  <br/>
  The Philosophy is in-depth and well thought through. In fact it could be regarded today as advanced particle (meta) physics.
</p>
<p>
The theory is the same as for all the Taoist Practices including Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, Acupuncture and Internal Alchemy etc.
</p>
<p>
The Creation of Qi (energy), it's  various types, qualities, and interactions is key.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of different <b>Schools</b> of Feng Shui. The Form School, Compass School, Black Sect School and Flying Star School.
The Classical School was an amalgam of the Form and Compass Schools and is what I am explaining on this website.
</p>
<hr/>

<h2> Feng Shui  - Definition</h2>
  <p>
    Literal translation - <b>Wind</b> (&) <b>Water</b>
  </p>
  <p>
<b>Feng</b> (wind) is energy (qi) that flows above the ground and occupies every space there is ( totally filling the void of the physical world ), it flows as wind, and is fast moving. It's characteristics are dependent upon the direction in which it flows and the environment it occupies. It can be partially described as electromagnetically charged particles in the atmosphere.
  </p>
  <p>
<b>Shui</b> (water) is energy (qi) that is contained within the earth and (by connection with) inherent in the structure of a building (all mass), it is slow moving. 
It is experienced as a cool blue energy, hence being called water, it is essentially gravitational force.
</p>
  <i>NB There is another main force called "cosmic particle dust",  basically stardust". This force seems not to be used in Feng Shui assessments but is integral in the Martial Arts. [ see  the <a href="advanced.html">Advanced</a> section ]</i>
</p>
<p>
  The practice of Feng Shui aims to <b>balance environmental Qi </b>to benefit the occupant/s. It is a system of assessing the quality of energies at play and calculating how they interact.
</p>
[ <i>It should be noted that although there are many variations, essentially, in terms of suitability, it boils down to two main generalised types of environment and personal energy types. The Eastern and Western "cycle". 
  A building or partner with the same cycle as your personal ( horoscope ) reading is most suited.
  <br/>
  I will go into this later on. </i> ] 
</p>
<hr/>

<h2> Application</h2>
<p>
  A Magnetic <b>Compass</b>, known as a "Lo Pan", is used to determine site/space orientation, the energies at play and interactions. Qi has different characteristics dependant upon direction ( of movement ).
  <br/>
  <i>[ please refer to the <b> <a href="8directions.html">8 Directions</a>  </b>section of this site for details ]</i> 
</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Assessment</h2> 
<p>
  Assessment is based on orientation, a personal reading  and other general observations which are outlined below.
</p>
<p>
An assessment of a site begins outside (Macro environment) and works inwards (Micro environment) to smaller internal spaces. 
Always consider the macro (larger) environment first as this is the main feed of Qi to the site, and work your way down to the micro (small, internal placement).
</p>

</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Feng Shui - key aims</h2>
<p>
  Balancing the site for the Qi present is most important.
  <br/>
  <i>It may be that, for the time being, the occupants are not suited to the site, and are not currently able to move immediately. Really balancing ones own qi is the most important.</i>
</p>
<p>
</p>

  <ul style="line-height:1.5em;">
    <li> To determine the best site/building for individuals.</li>
    <li>To balance the property to suit the occupants, and maximise its potential.</li>
    <li>To ensure an ample supply of good Qi into the property/space</li>
    <li>a natural flow throughout.</li>
    <li>Suggest changes to the buildings internal layout.</li>
    <li>Changing locations and orientation of doors / windows to affect the main energy and its exchange of   a building / space.</li>
    <li>Counteract malign influences. "Shar" = bad qi ( more specifically, detrimental fast flowing or aggressive )</li>
    <li>Position furniture, objects, working, living, sleeping areas favourably (using portents derived from Baguas).
</li>
    
  </ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Nb. Colour is a simple and effective way to manipulate the energy of rooms/spaces. using the 5 element cycle).</i>
</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Mythology</h2>
<p>
All ancient traditions use metaphors, symbology and myth in explanation.
Therefore taking things "literally" can lead to misinterpretation.
<br/>
It is an excellent way of condensing a large amount of information into a usable form. After all, the point of knowledge is to integrate it into your being.
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <b>An example:</b>  
The Green Dragon is a great mythological figure in traditional Chinese culture  and is  the symbol of the Emperor. The Green Dragon is the symbol of fertility and male vigour and also represents the East, the Wood element and the eastern side of a building. The Green Dragon has the same attributes as the element Wood. (please refer to the  5 element section of this site). The Green Dragon is the source of rain,  water is his life blood and he breathes fire (Water feeds Wood (the dragon) and creates Fire). This interaction relates to what is known as 'The Eastern Life' or the directions and elements on the Eastern Generative Cycle (water, wood, small wood and fire - N,E,SE,S). The 'Western Life' directions are NE,SW,W & NW and this is symbolised by the White Tiger. You may have heard of the Dragon and Tiger (left and right) side of a building and Dragon and Tiger shaped hill formations.
