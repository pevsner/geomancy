    <!-- ##### PREAMBLE ##### -->
    
    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    <p>
      In order to grasp Feng Shui one needs to have a basic understanding of Taoist philosophy and theory.
      The next section attempts to do this.
      <br/>
      <br/>
    <b>Taoism</b> is a <b>way of being</b> or <b>path</b> not a religion (see the quote opposite).
      <br/>
      It is thought to originate from the actions and writings (apparently under duress) of <b>Lao Tzu</b>.
      <br/>
      Myth has it that Lao Tzu lived 700 years.
      <br/><br/>
      The Taoist text the <b>"Tao Te Ching"</b> written by Lao Tzu, sometime between 600 BC and 400 BC, is poetic in style and concise in information. His later work, the <b>"Hua Hua Ching"</b>, contains more specific information on energetic interactions.
      <br/>
Lao Tzu realised that <b>everything was connected</b>, the <b>planets</b>, the <b>elements</b> and all the <b>living things</b>. He deduced that there were <b>common elemental forces and attributes</b> that <b>link everything</b> in the <b>cosmos</b>.
      <br/><br/>
      By <b>connecting</b> to these <b>forces</b> through Meditation and <b>Taoist practices</b> (such as <b>Qi Gong, Tai Qi Chuan & Internal Alchemy</b>) one is able to <b>increase</b> physical and subtle <b>energy levels</b> and build a strong <b>platform</b> for <b>spiritual development</b>.
      <br/>
      <i> It is like connecting the positive (heaven) and negative (earth) electric leads to give power. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>[ comment ]</b> Martial arts practices, some based on this understanding, were used to train warriors. The invention of gun powder saw it's large scale decline.
	<br/>
	The slowness of excercise (especially in Qi Gong, Tai Qi) was to fully experience the energy flow, not confused with normal physical exertion. When mastered it could be speeded up as neccessary for combat.
	<br/>
	My take on the history is (?) An in-tune dude spends ages trying to harness great energies over a long period of time, the knowledge gets out and is passed around by world of mouth and then is taken up by the military to ekk out every avantage possible in battle. Gunpowder arrives and it's dropped mainstream. ] 
      </i>
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Grounding and rootedness to the earth is the launch pad to the spiritual.</li>
	<li>
	  The more grounded you become the subtler the energies you experience.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The subtler the energies you absorb, the stronger you become on all levels.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Spiritual development is a natural outcome.
	</li>
	<li>
	 <i> Nothing is forced because you have a firm foundation.</i>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <br/> 
      
      Modern standard Science is based on the rational, Cartesian method of observation, derivative theories and projected models.
      <br/>
      <i>Modern "cutting edge" physics is more abstract.</i>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Taoism</b> is, a "way", a guide to advancement. It is backed up with a very rational explanation of energy exchange in the cosmos and how humans are affected.
      <br/>
      The main point is to <b>extend ones life</b> so that one can advance to a very high level and transcend the cycle of a normal human.
      <br/>
      <i>The cycle of life and death, development through childhood, reduced capacity in later years, took up so much time.
	<br/>
	By living healthily for a long time, one would be able to have more general experience, have developed skills, and clear thinking time, allowing subtler levels to reveal themselves.</i>
    </p>
    <p> <i>[ Comment :  The future relevance, of "micro feng shui" readings may be somewhat diminished as we are affected more and more by man-made electro-magnetic/radio waves like city wide wifi, G5 mobile networks and the Elon Musk proposed low orbiting internet infrastucture. Even if we adapt to the "fallout" from new technologys, the subtle energy levels will be disturbed.
      <br/>
      Eg. Trying to harness the subtle levels of energy when you are living 20M from a G5 telephone mast is pretty futile. The best course of action would be to move. ]</i>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Macro</b> assessment is the most important, <b>micro</b> less so.
      <br/>
      If the buildings siting and relationship to the surroundings is benificial, then working on the micro readings is worthwhile.
      <br/>
      If the macro reading is bad, deal with that first as micro changes are probably not going to do much.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overall people and buildings basically fall into 2 categories:
      <br/>
      <b>Eastern Life: </b>Water (N), Wood (E), Small Wood (SE) & Fire (S).
      <br/>
      <b>Western Life: </b>Small Earth (NE), Earth (SW), Metal (W) & Big Metal (NW). 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It's best if you partner with and live in places that are on the same cycle as you.
      <br/>
      <i>Not the whole story, all sorts of intellectualisations can be made, but probably easiest and the best.</i>

    <!-- ##### QI ENERGY ###### -->
    
    <h2>Qi (energy)</h2>
    <p> Qi, is energy in all forms, from coarse (physical things, including the atmosphere) to the very subtle (beyond the immaterial). </p>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Absorbtion</h2>
    <p>
The diagram illustrates the main subtle forces that effect us. We absorb these forces naturally to sustain life.
<br/><br/>
<b>Heaven energy</b>.
<br/>
Experienced as a  <b>warm red</b> energy spiralling down from the heavens. It is the effect of planetary movement.
<br/>
<b>Yang</b> in quality.
<br/><br/>
<b>Cosmic Particle Dust</b>.
<br/>
Primarily absorbed/recieved (energy and informatio)n through a spot in the middle of the forehead ( similar concept to the third eye chakra).
<br/>
This force contains <b>unlimited information</b>. <i> [ presumably because of the condensed amount of microscopic information. ]</i>
<br/>
<i>Nb. Basically "star dust", of which humans are mainly made up of. ( recall the Crosby, Stills and Nash song ).</i>

    <p>Geomancy is "Earth Divination" involving the reading of energetic interactions on earth and how they affect us. Most ancient cultures (Aboriginal, African, American Indian, Druid, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Indian, Nordic, Mayan and the Renaissance period, etc.) had/have their own systems of explanation.
<br><br>
Feng Shui, the Chinese Taoist form of Geomancy, provides the most comprehensive and well documented type.

      The theory underlying Feng Shui is the same for all Taoist practices. (including; Martial arts (Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, etc.), Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal remedies etc.) and Internal Alchemy).
      </p>
      <p>
Energy (called "Qi") its creation, varied qualities and interactions is key.
      </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of Schools of Feng Shui: The Form School, The Compass School, The Black Sect School, The Flying Star School & The Classical School.
      <br/>
      The Classical School is a mixture of the Form and Compass Schools and is explained here.

Feng is Qi (energy) that flows above the ground and occupies every space there is, it flows as wind, and is fast moving. It's characteristics are dependent upon the direction in which it flows and the environment it occupies. It can be partially described as electromagnetically charged particles in the atmosphere.
<br/><br/>
Shui is Qi (energy) that is contained within the earth and is inherent in the structure of a building (mass), it is slow moving. Shui can be experienced as a cool blue energy, hence being called water, it is essentially gravitational force.
<br/><br/>
The practice of Feng Shui aims to balance these energies to benefit the occupant/s. It is a system of assessing the quality of energies at play and calculating how they interact.

Everything is connected, the planets, the elements and all the living things.
What we experience externally reflects our internal universe. Hence our environment is a reflection of ourselves and vice versa. Balancing the external environment has a direct effect upon our internal condition and helps us to realize our potential.
