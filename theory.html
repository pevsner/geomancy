    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    <p>
      What I am explaining on this entire site is <b>Taoist</b> philosophy and  metaphysics.
      <br/>
      <i>( my understanding of it at least )</i>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Q.   What is the point?
      <br/>
      A. Curiosity into the workings of the Cosmos, how we fit into it and how we can use the knowledge.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Modern (Cartesian) Science is based on <b>observation</b> and projected theories/models based.
      <br/>
      <i>Modern "cutting edge" physics is more abstract.</i>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Taoism</b> is a <b>"way"</b>, a guide to advancement. It is backed up with a very rational explanation of energy exchanges in
      the cosmos and how humans are affected.
      <br/>
      The main point of it was to <b>extend ones life</b> in order that you could advance to a very high level and transcend
      the cycle of normal human existence.
      <br/>
      <i>The cycle of life and death, development through childhood, reduced capacity in later years, took up so much time.
	<br/>
	By living healthily for a long time, one would be able to have more general experience, have developed skills, and clear
	thinking time, allowing subtler levels
	to reveal themselves.</i>
    </p>
    <p> <i>[ Comment :  The future relevance, of "micro feng shui" readings may be somewhat diminished as we are affected more and more by man-made electro-magnetic/radio waves like city wide wifi, G5 mobile networks and the Elon Musk proposed low orbiting internet infrastucture. Even if we adapt to the "fallout" from new technologys, the subtle energy levels will be disturbed.
      <br/>
      Eg. Trying to harness the subtle levels of energy when you are living 20M from a G5 telephone mast is pretty futile. The best course of action would be to move. ]</i>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    
    <h2>Qi (energy)</h2>
    <p> Qi, is energy, from coarse (physical things, atmosphere) to the very subtle (beyond the immaterial). </p>
    <p><b>Taoism</b> is a name, for a <b>way of being</b> or <b>path</b> not a religion (see the quote opposite).
      <br/>
      It is thought to originate from the actions and writings (apparently under duress) of <b>Lao Tzu</b>.
      <br/>
      Myth has it that Lao Tzu lived 700 years.
      <br/><br/>
      The classic Taoist text the <b>"Tao Te Ching"</b> written by Lao Tzu, sometime between 6 BC and 3 BC, is poetic in style but sublimely concise, containing many layers of detailed insight. Lao Tzus' later work, the <b>"Hua Hua Ching"</b>, contains more specific information on energetic interactions. (see reading list for details).
      <br/>
Lao Tzu realised that <b>everything was connected</b>, the <b>planets</b>, the <b>elements</b> and all the <b>living things</b>. He deduced that there were <b>common elemental forces and attributes</b> that <b>link everything</b> in the <b>cosmos</b>.
      <br/><br/>
      By <b>connecting</b> to these <b>forces</b> through Meditation and <b>Taoist practices</b> (such as <b>Qi Gong, Tai Qi Chuan & Internal Alchemy</b>) one is able to <b>increase</b> physical and subtle <b>energy levels</b> and build a strong <b>platform</b> for <b>spiritual development</b>.
      <br/>
      <i> It is like connecting the positive (heaven) and negative (earth) electric leads to give power. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Nb. Martial arts practices, some based on this understanding, were used to train warriors. The invention of gun powder saw it's large scale decline.
	<br/>
	The slowness of excercise was to fully experience the energy flow, not confused with normal physical exertion. When mastered it could be speeded up as neccessary for combat.
	<br/>
	[ Coment: My take on the history is (?) An in-tune dude spends ages trying to harness great energies over a long period of time, the knowledge gets out and is passed around by world of mouth and then is taken up by the military to ekk out every avantage possible in battle. Gunpowder arrives and it's dropped mainstream. ] 
      </i>

    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Grounding and rootedness to the earth is the launch pad to the spiritual.</li>
	<li>
	  The more grounded you become the subtler the energies you experience.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The subtler the energies you absorb, the stronger you become on all levels.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Spiritual development is a natural outcome.
	</li>
	<li>
	 <i> Nothing is forced because you have a firm foundation.</i>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <br/> 
    <hr/>
    <h2>Absorbtion</h2>
    <p>
The diagram illustrates the main subtle forces that effect us. We absorb these forces naturally to sustain life.
<br/><br/>
<b>Heaven energy</b>.
<br/>
Experienced as a  <b>warm red</b> energy spiralling down from the heavens. It is the effect of planetary movement.
<br/>
<b>Yang</b> in quality.
<br/><br/>
<b>Cosmic Particle Dust</b>.
<br/>
Primarily absorbed/recieved (energy and informatio)n through a spot in the middle of the forehead ( similar concept to the third eye chakra).
<br/>
This force contains <b>unlimited information</b>. <i> [ presumably because of the condensed amount of microscopic information. ]</i>
<br/>
<i>Nb. Basically "star dust", of which humans are mainly made up of. ( recall the Crosby, Stills and Nash song ).</i>
<br/><br/>

<b>Earth Force</b>.
<br/>
Experienced as a <b>cool blue</b> energy spiralling up from the earth. The healing quality comes from the special relationship between the earth and the moon.
<br/>
<b>Yin</b> in quality.
<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <hr/>

    <h2>The Microcosmic Orbit</h2>
    <p>
      With practice, one can develop the <b>circulation of Qi</b> around the Microcosmic <b>Orbit</b> to great personal benefit.
      <br/>
      The greater the circulation the more easily external energy is drawn into the cycle and the stronger one becomes.
      <br/>
      <i>Nb. I do suggest that you should clear your channels (correct vertical (spinal) structural alignment) sufficiently to be able to fully feel the energies before circulating.</i> 
      <br/>
      The basic premise is: Qi will follow your minds eye.
      <br/>
      [ Comment: The more concious you become of the flow, you will intuitively feel blocks to this flow, don't stop, continue the cycle, complete and center ]
      </i>
      <br/>
      <br/>

There are many sources of information available which will give you instruction on the practice of circulating internal Qi.
      <br/>
I would recommend you look at the work of <b>Mantak Chia</b> (see reading list) as he provide perhaps the most comprehensive explanations of Chinese Metaphysics and Taoist practices (Alchemy, Qi Gong) available in English.
      <br/>
      <br/>
<b>Governor channel</b> runs up the middle of the back.
<br/>
<b>Functional channel</b> runs down the chest.
<br/>
<i>(Connecting the two channels is achieved by pressing the tongue to the top of the palate and pulling up the anus).
</i>.
    </p>
    
    <hr/> 
    <h2>The 8 Directions</h2>
    <p>
      The Chinese discovered that Qi (energy) had differing characteristics depending upon the direction of movement. They derived a system of reading these energetic interactions using the main Elements. <br/>
      <i>Essentially a flavor of the main 5 elements energy by directions.<br/>
Eg. Imagine: A field of particles moving in one direction has certain qualities, moving in another direction is has a different quality. It makes sense in that the earth magnetism is, somewhat, constant and any directional change will produce a different outcome. 
      </i>
      <br/>
<br/>

A <b>Compass (Lo Pan)</b> is used to obtain information on orientation and qualities of energy.<br> It has a normal <b>magnetic compass</b> at its center with radiating additional markings indicating the main <b>8 directions</b>, the <b>former and later heavenly sequences</b>, further elemental subdivisions (down to 2 degress), <b>portents</b> (fortune/misfortune ) of spaces, <b>Water Dragon</b> information and more.
    </p>
    <h2>The Baguas</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Bagua </b> is the Chinese for 8 directions.
<br/>
The 8 main directions are illustrated opposite.
They are general divisions of the main directional energies.
<br/>
<br/>

The 8 directions each have characteristics of the 5 elements.
With 3 variants.
<b>| N=Water | NE=small Earth | E=Wood | SE=small Wood | S=Fire | SW=Earth | W=Metal | NW=small Metal |</b>
<br/>
<i> SW and NE whilst both being of the earth element differed markedly in quality. So to with W & NW (metal) and E & SE (wood).</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>
NB.The eight main directions are the most commonly used, however there are further subdivisions (2 degree divisions) which can give a more detailed divination - for specific work (desk) and furniture positioning and the calculation of the "Water Dragon" (orientation of external water flows in relation to a building).</i>
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Heavenly Bagua</b>. The inner Trigrams relate to the "Former Heavenly Sequence". A system derived to explain the energy of free flowing Feng.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Earthly Bagua</b>. The outer Trigrams relate to the "Later Heavenly Sequence". A system derived to explain the exchange of energy within a building/space. Essentially the earth energy (Shui) component  inherent in the structure or gravitational effect .
<br/>
<br/>

The Heavenly Bagua is moveable and the Earthly Bagua is fixed. Correctly combining and reading these two Bagua's gives the portent of a particular space.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>
NB. The Chinese always show fire (south) at the top because it relates to the heavens(S, fire, yang) above and the earth(N, water, yin) below.</i>
<br/>
<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Lo Shu ( magic square )</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Lo Shu</b> is a numeric magic square which said to have been found as markings the back of a Turtle.
<br/>
<br/>
It ties in the 8 directions and seasonal changes and relates to personal horoscope numbers. (see horoscope section to calculate your own personal number).
<br/>
<br/>
Odd and even numbers alternate in the periphery of the square, the four corners are even numbers, and the 5 odd numbers form a cross in the centre.
<br/>Each line (vertical, horizontal and diagonal) add up to 15, which is the number of days in each of the 24 cycles of the Chinese solar year.
<br/>
<br/>
I have indicated how the seasons tie in as well as how the amount of Yin and Yang varies. Maximum Yin during winter, increasing Yang and decreasing Yin to mid summer and vice versa.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Readings</h2>
    <p>
Whilst each space contains all of the five element energies - the entry point (door position) is key to determining what element has the most influence.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>E.g.. Qi flowing into a room facing south has the general characteristic of the fire element. </i>
The two Bagua's (Earthly and Heavenly) give insight into the properties and interactions of energy by direction. 
    </p>
    <h2>Earthly Bagua</h2> 
    <p>
These spaces refer to the general characteristic of an internal space. Relating to the true actual magnetic orientation of spaces within a room.
<br/>

The energetic characteristics can be summarised simply, as shown below.
    </p>
    <h2>Heavenly Bagua</h2>
    <p>
These <b>portents</b> tell us the interactions of free flowing energy (Qi) with the stable state of the above Earthly Bagua.

    <h2>The 5 Elements</h2>
    <p>
The 5 Elements describe the main types of energy (Taoists identified) in the physical world. Everything in the physical world (visible or invisible - including air, electromagnetic fields etc.) has the overall characteristic of one of the Elements.
<br/>
<br/>
Understanding their qualities and the way they interact helps us to implement Feng Shui.
    </p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
Chinese Taoists discovered a supreme natural power which they called "<b>Wu Qi</b>".
<br/>
<br/>
Wu Qi means nothingness. 
( in essense the source of everything that follows ).
<i>Nb. From the "Tao Te Ching", something from nothing, the ultimate source is from nothing. This may be a reference to "anti-mater"?  </i>
All things in the spiritual realm are unified, all things in the physical world are dualities.
<br/>
<br/>
There have been various cross-over theories to explain this Original force in Scientific speak. 
One theory is that the "nothingness " is what Physicists describe as "Dark Matter" or subtle sub atomic entities. 
Dark Matter (according to modern physicists) makes up the majority of the universe accounting for approximately 90%,
 with the remaining 10% being the physical universe, or what we. kinda know of, as physical (planets, atmosphere, people,stuff). 
<br/>
Please see the "advanced" section for more detail. 
<br/>
The diagram opposite shows the transformation of energy from subtle to physical. It explains everything. From unity (Wu Qi), splitting into (Yin and Yang(duality)) and then (dependent on the quality and proportions) forming the variety of our world  (5 Elements to 64 hexagrams and beyond).
    </p>
    <h2>Yin and Yang to 5 Elements</h2>
    <p>
The Chinese used a binary system to describe the quality of energy. 
<br/>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>YANG</th>
    <th>+'ve </th>
    <th>solid line</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>YIN</th>
    <th>-'ve</th>
    <th>broken line</th>
  </tr>
</table>
    <p>
<i>(please refer to the Yin & Yang section for an explanation).</i>
<br/>
    </p>
<p>
  <b>Physical energy</b> is manifested as the <b>body</b>
  <br/>
  <b>Subtle energy</b> manifested as the <b>mind and spirit</b>.
<br/>
<b>TAI QI</b>  (is the balanced integration of the yin and yang).
<br/>
<br/>
Scientist are well aware of the 4 main forces 
<br/>
<b>strong nuclear</b>, 
<br/>
<b>weak nuclear</b>,
<br/>
<b>gravity</b>
<br/>
<b>electromagnetism</b>
 
<br/>
<br/>
The Taoists deduced that there was a <b>5th harmonising force</b> (named Earth). The natural way is for the 4 forces ( fire, metal, water and wood ) to fight it out ( in conflict ). It is the earth element which harmonises. 

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Fire</b> symbolises > spirit / mental energy.
<br/>

<b>Earth</b> symbolises >  the united, harmonising and neutral force.
<br/>

<b>Metal</b> symbolises > characterised by gravity.
<br/>

<b>Water</b> symbolises > aggregation, contraction, collection, condensation.
<br/>

<b>Wood</b> symbolises > explosion, disaggregate, dispersion, dissipation.
    </p>
    <h2>The 5 Element Cycle</h2>
    <p>
The five element cycle is the key to understanding energy exchange. There are regular and abnormal cycles which are described below.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Normal and regular (generative) cycle</b>
<br/>The creative positive interaction of energies.
<br/>
<b>Fire</b> feeds earth ( ash / nutrients ).
<br/>
<b>Earth</b> feeds metal ( minerals ).
<br/>
<b>Metal</b> feeds water ( metal sweats ).
<br/>
<b>Water</b> feeds wood.
<br/>
<b>Wood</b> feeds fire.
<br/>
Earth is at the centre, with it's harmonising influence.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Abnormal (control) cycle</b>
<br/>
The controling and/or destructive interaction of energies
<br/>
<b>Fire</b> controls metal ( melts ).
<br/>
<b>Metal</b> controls wood ( chops ). 
<br/>
<b>Wood</b> controls earth (  extracts ).
<br/>
<b>Earth</b> controls water ( contains ).
<br/>
<b>Water</b> controls fire ( extinguishes ).
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nb. There are further levels to these exchanges. Eg. Big fire combined with small water creates steam which is very auspicious.</i>

    </p>
    <h2>The Elemental Clock</h2>
    <p>
Each element is more active during certain months, years and times of the day. (see horoscope section for months and years information).
<br/>
<br/>
The clock diagram opposite shows which organ of the body is more active at what time. You will see below (attributes table) that there are yin and yang organs. Yin organs produce, transform and store qi whilst the yang organs separate the impure and expel waste.
    </p>
    <h2>5 Element Attributes</h2>    
    <p>
The table below describes the common attributes of the five elements.
