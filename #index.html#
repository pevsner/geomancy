<h3>Feng Shui</h3>
<p>The Taoists explained energetic interactions with a
system derived from their knowledge of creation. The
theory underlying Feng Shui is the same for all Taoist
  practices including the Martial arts (Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, etc.).Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal remedies etc.)and Internal Alchemy.</p>
<p><i>The concept of Qi (energy) its creation, varied
qualities and interactions is key.</p>
<p>There are a number of different Schools<span class="small_text">(approaches)</span>&nbsp;of
Feng Shui (Form School, Compass School, Black
Sect School, Flying Star School and  Classical School). The
Classical School is an amalgam of traditional theories and this is
explained here.</i></p>

<p><font color="red"><b>Feng</b></font> is Qi <span class="small_text">(energy)</span>
that flows above the ground and
occupies every space there is, it flows as wind, and is fast moving.
It's characteristics are dependent upon the direction in which it flows
and the environment it occupies. It can be partially described as
electromagnetically charged particles in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><font color="#66ccff"><b>Shui</b></font>
is Qi <span class="small_text">(energy)</span> that
is contained within the earth and is inherent in
the structure of a building <span class="small_text">(all
mass)</span>, it is slow moving. Shui can be
experienced as a cool blue energy, hence being called water, it is
essentially gravitational force.</p>

<p>The practice of Feng Shui aims to balance these energies
to benefit the occupant/s. It is a system of assessing the quality of
energies at play and calculating how they interact.</p>
