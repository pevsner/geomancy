<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Geomancy is the reading of energetic interactions on earth and how they affect us. (geo=earth,
    mancy=divination or reading).
    <br>
    <br>
    Most ancient cultures (Aboriginal, African, American Indian, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Indian,
    Nordic, Mayan etc.) have their own systems of explanation.
    <br>
    <br>
    Feng Shui, the Chinese Taoist form of Geomancy, provides one of the most comprehensive and well
    documented explanations.
  </p>
  <img class="center"; title="world" alt="world" src="imgs/world.jpg">
<h2></a>Feng Shui - general</h2>
  <p>The Taoists explained energetic interactions with a
    system derived from their knowledge of creation. The theory underlying Feng Shui is the same for
    all Taoist practices including the Martial arts (Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, etc.),
    Medicine (Acupuncture, Herbal remedies etc.) and Internal Alchemy.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
  <p>The concept of Qi (energy) its creation, varied qualities and interactions is key.<br>
    <br>
    There are a number of different Schools (approaches) of Feng Shui (Form School, Compass School,
    Black Sect School, Flying Star School Classical School). The Classical School is an amalgam of
    traditional theories and this is explained here.</p>

<h2><a name="definition"></a>Feng
Shui - definition</h2><p><font color="red"><b>Feng</b></font><b>
</b> is Qi (energy) that flows above the ground and
occupies every space there is, it flows as wind, and is fast moving.
It's characteristics are dependent upon the direction in which it flows
and the environment it occupies. It can be partially described as
electromagnetically charged particles in the atmosphere.<br>
<br>
<font color="#66ccff"><b>Shui</b></font>
is Qi (energy) that is contained within the earth and is inherent in
the structure of a building (all mass), it is slow moving. Shui can be
experienced as a cool blue energy, hence being called water, it is
essentially gravitational force.<br>
<br>
The practice of Feng Shui aims to balance these energies
to benefit the occupant/s. It is a system of assessing the quality of
energies at play and calculating how they interact.(Yang) above<br>
<br class="small_text">
water - Shui (Yin) below.</p>

<h2>Feng Shui - application</h2>
<p>A magnetic compass (Lo Pan) is used to determine
site/space orientation, the relevant energies at play and how
they interact. Qi (energy) has different characteristics dependant upon
  direction.
  <br>
  ( please refer to the <a href="8 directions.html">8 Directions</a> section of this site for
  details).
<br>:w
Assessment is based on orientation, personal reading and other general observations which are
outlined below.</p>

<p class="pcenter">Lo Pan - Compass</p>

  <h2>Feng Shui - Assessment</h2>
<p>An assessment of the site begins outside and works inwards.
  <br>
Consider the macro (large) environment first and work your way down to the micro (small).</p>

</li>
<li>Using colour to manipulate the energy of rooms/spaces favourably,(using the 5 element cycle).

<li>Changing locations and orientation of doors/windows to affect the main energy and its exchange
  of a building/space.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Mythology"></a>Mythology</h2>
<p>All ancient traditions use metaphors and myth in explanation.<br>
An over emphasis on 'taking things literally' can lead to misinterpretation.<br>
<br>
Myth and symbology are an excellent way of condensing a large amount of information into a usable
form. After all, the point of knowledge is to integrate it into your being.<br>
<br>
<p class="psmall">An example:<br>
  The Green Dragon is a great mythological figure in traditional Chinese culture and is the symbol
  of the Emperor. The Green Dragon is the symbol of fertility and male vigour and also represents
  the East, the Wood element and the eastern side of a building.
<br>
The Green Dragon has the same attributes as the element Wood. (please refer to the The Green
Dragon is the source of rain, water is his life blood and he breathes fire(Water feeds Wood
(the dragon) and creates Fire). This interaction relates to what is known as 'The Eastern Life' or
the directions and elements on the Eastern Generative Cycle (water, wood, small wood and
fire - N,E,SE,S).
The 'Western Life' directions are NE,SW,W,NW and this is symbolised by the White Tiger.
You may have heard of the Dragon and Tiger (left and right) side of a building and Dragon and
Tiger shaped hill formations.
</p>
<h4>Footnote:</h4>
<p class="psmall1">Everything is connected, the planets, the elements and
all the living things.What we experience externally reflects our internal
universe. Hence our environ`ment is a reflection of ourselves and vice
versa. Balancing the external environment has a direct effect upon our
internal condition and helps us to realize our potential.</p>
