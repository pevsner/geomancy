	    Geomancy is a method of reading the Earths (sometimes planets and beyond) effect on us.
	    <b>Geo

	    <b> Mancy
	    </b> = divination or reading.

	    Many Ancient Cultures, including Aboriginal (Shamanic), African tribes, American Indian (Shamanic), Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Indian, Nordic (including Viking), South American (Mayan and Inca), have their own systems. Most are not really relevant today. They vary in sophistication from African tribe stick throwing divination to Renaissance metaphysics (which was a very prolific period of combining science with spiritual dimensions.  
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    The Chinese Taoist Art of Feng Shui is the most comprehensive and well documented type.
	    It involves a very detailed site analysis, including a Personal Horoscope, to guide on what needs changing are to achieve an environmental balance.
	    There's no magic/faith involved, it is a very precise and logical practice.
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    <i>A lot of modern "pseudo" feng shui borrows from other sources including "the new age" and "shamanic" ideas. This is not classical Feng Shui, it is, more like, "interior design" with a spiritual angle.
	    </i>
	  <p/>
	  <p>Classical Feng Shui is an amalgam of the Form, Compass and Flying Star Schools.

	<h2>Feng Shui - General

	<div class="column1">
	  <p>
	    The Chinese Taoist Art of Feng Shui is used to determine the best siting and planning of a building.
	    <br/>
	    Primarily developed for new buildings, Palaces, it subsequently became commonly adopted.
	    Nowadays it is a must before moving or setting up business in large parts of Asia.
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    It is based on Taoist understanding of universal energy exchanges, derived from the writings of Lao Tzu (the "Tao Te Ching" and "Hua Hua Ching") and the "I Ching" (the classic "book of change"). Other practices were absorbed over time. 
	    <br/>
	    The same principles apply to all Taoist practices including Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, Acupuncture and Internal Alchemy.
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    The aim is to balance the environment to suit the inhabitants. It is done by observing energy exchanges (from planetary movement, the larger landscape/topography/orientation, local landscape, down to very small internal spaces) and how they affect us. Horoscopes of individuals are also calculated to further determine suitability.

	    Feng Shui is about balancing Qi (energy) so residents can live in harmony with the environment.
	    <br/>
	    From receiving a good flow of energy from the larger topographical surroundings, to internal flows of energy circulating to all rooms, to the fine positioning of objects.
	    <br/>
	    <br/>
	    Qi is a, generalised, Chinese word for energy: from Heavenly ( planetary) to Earthly ( physical ), coarse to subtle.
	    <br/>
	    *WuQi, TaiQi, Yin & Yang, the 5 elements, the 8 directions, the 64 hexagrams,
	    There is an Original Source energy, WuQi (unified, from which everything else comes)
	    <br/>
	    Then there is the duality of physical universe. Yin and Yang (-'ve and +'ve, male & female, light & dark)
	    <br/>
	    All the other sub groups of Qi are variations of above ones, and include:
