Beware of everything, books are dangerous.

TAO TE CHING, Lao Tsu (shambhala)
HUA HUA CHING, Lao Tzu (shambhala)
( there are other translations available, obviously there is
always interprutation )

Feng Shui specific books, I find it difficult to recommend any, there
is common ground across the more traditional ones. The "new age", "shamanic" fusion ones seem to thrive on "balony", intention, affermations, symbology with a splash of "hocus pocus". This might on a trivial level have some kind of placebo effect, but is unsustainable for any groth. As with all challenges, ones the illusion is dissapated, it becomes familiar and you can move on without believing it's magic. 

Here are a few in the past I had listed, not sure any more.
