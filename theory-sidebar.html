	<h1>Theory</h1>
	<div class="column1">
	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <p>
The theory behind Feng Shui is the same for all Taoist practices including Tai Qi, Qi Gong, Acupuncture, internal Alchemy and more.
<br/>
The Taoists understanding of Cosmic and Earthly energy exchanges developed into a formalised system of classification  and calculation.  A binary system of trigrams and hexagrams was used to depict qualities. <i>( solid line=Yang, broken line = Yin)</i>
<br/>
<i>
  <ul>
  Energy types:
    <li>Wu Qi : Original Source energy ></li>
    <li>Tai Qi : Balanced fusion of Yin & Yang energies > (splits into)</li>
    <li>Yin : Female energy, -'ve charge & </li>
    <li>Yang : Male energy, +'ve charge. ></li>
    <li>The 5 Elements : Five general energy types ></li>
    <li>The 8 Directions : Eight directional energies ></li>
    <li>The 64 Hexagram's : 8x8 interactions, more specific types.</li>
  </ul>
</i>
The Basic premise was;
<br/>
There was/is an Original Source energy, <b>'Wu Qi'</b>, from which the everything was created and continually renews. This is unlike the energy in the Universe we know, it is a unity (one). <i>ie. Has no +'ve nor -'ve charge.</i> 
<br/>
<br/>
'Wu Qi' energy changes from a unity state (one) to binary (two) when it transforms into physical manifestations. It splits into <b>Yin</b> (female, -'ve charge) and <b>Yang</b> (male, +'ve charge) energies. 
All things in the physical Universe consist of varying, individually specific, proportions of Yin & Yang. The proportion determines character, properties and interaction.
<br/>
<br/>
Five main energy types were identified, <b>'The Five Elements'</b> (Earth, Metal,Water,Wood & Fire) , to represent their qualities and interactions .  In Scientific language they can be thought of as the four fundamental forces: <b>Gravity, Electromagnetism, Strong Nuclear</b> and <b>Weak Nuclear</b>. The Taoists included a fifth unifying force called <b>'Earth'</b>.
<br/>
<br/>
The use of the '5 Elements'  is real and symbolic. <i>eg. The Element Water is the main energy found in water, but also is the main element in a approximately a fifth of everything (the planet Mercury and the Kidney organs for instance)</i> 
<br/>
Each Element describes its own inherent qualities and how it interacts with the others. <i>eg. Wood feeds Fire (this would be a 'creative' exchange), whereas, Water douses Fire (this would be a controlling/destructive exchange).</i>
<br/>
Proportion is obviously a factor. <i>eg. one cup of water won't extinguish a bonfire.</i>
<br/>
<br/>
Two <b>'5 Element Cycles'</b> express generative and controlling exchanges. 
<br/>
<br/>
Energy has different qualities based on direction <i>(eg. energy coming from the south has the property of Fire) </i>and so a system called <b>The 8 Directions</b> (Bagua) was devised to describe energy types based on Compass orientation. <i>[ these are the same 5 Elements with three additional distinct flavors. ( small Earth, small Wood & small Metal ) ]</i> 
<br/>

<h2>+ Theory</h2>
<h3>Wu Qi</h3>
	<p>   
   WuQi is "nothingness". The original source from which the cosmos was born and reborn.
   It is a unity, a single thing, not of the physical universe.
   <br/>
   A, currently scientifically un-explainable, force that animates living things. Much more than spirit, the ultimate life force.
   <br/>
   Scientists are aware of the existance, but know nothing of, <b>Dark Matter</b>.  They estimate it constitutes 90% of everything.  I believe Wu Qi is many levels deeper than
dark matter. <i>[ "from nothing comes something" . Man made physical manifestations come from ideas translated into design and then constructed. "As above, so below" ]</i> 
   <br/>
[ The best way to think of it is as the spark of animating life that enters a new being at the point of conception. ]
   <br/>
   Everything in the spiritual realm is a unity.
   <br/>
Everything on the physical plane is a duality.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Yin & Yang</h3>
	  <p>
Yin and Yang are the two opposing and complimentary energies that together form the basis of everything present in our perceived world. ( yang= solid line, yin=broken line )
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <b>Yang</b> (symbolised by a solid line) is the male principle or +'ve charge and
	    <br/>
	    <b>Yin</b> (symbolised by a broken line) is the female principle or -'ve charge.
<br/>
The proportion, quality and interactions of these two forces give rise to all varied physical manifestations.
Yin and Yang balanced and in harmony is called <b>'Tai Qi'</b>. The proportion of yin and yang in perfect (imperfect) harmony is 1: 1.61803. <i>[ Which is also the proportion of 'Phi' and the 'Golden Section' ]</i>

	<h2>The Trigrams & Hexagrams</h2>
	<div class="column1">
	  <p>
	    The trigrams and hexagrams are made up of three and six lines respectively. The illustrate the qualities of energy in proportion of of yin/yang ( +'ve, -'ve charge ). They are read from bottom to top. The base line being the most significant up till the top line being the finest of characteristic. <i>[ the bottom one effectively describing the gerneral sex ]</i>

	<h2>The 5 Elements</h2>
	<div class="column1">
	  <p>
The 5 Elements describe the main types of energy in the physical world. Everything in the physical world (visible or invisible - including air, electromagnetic fields etc.) has the overall characteristic of one of the Elements.

Understanding their qualities and the way they interact helps us to implement Feng Shui as well as diagose "well being" in Acupuncture.
