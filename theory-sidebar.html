	  <h2>Introduction
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    The theory undelying Feng Shui is the same for all Taoist practices including Tai Qi Chuan, Qi Gong, Acupuncture, internal Alchemy and more. Taoism is thought to be derived from the teaching and writings of
	    <b>Lao Tzu
	    </b> (circa 601BC).
<br/>
Their understanding developed into a system of energy classification and methodology for calculating interactions. 
<br/>
<br/>
<i>
  <b>Qi
  </b> is a generic term for energy, from subtle to coarse.
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
In short:
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Wu Qi
</b> is the original source energy from which everything is created. It is a unity state energy
<i>(consists of only one)
</i>. Wu Qi divides, when it transforms into the physical realm, becoming
<b>Yin
</b> (female, -'ve charge) and
<b>Yang
</b> (male, +'ve charge) . 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tai Qi
</b> is a state of balanced Yin and Yang.
<i>(Infact balanced imbalance, more later)
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Yin & Yang
</b>. All things in the physical realm consist of varying proportions of Yin & Yang. The proportion determines properties and interactions. A solid line was used to depict Yang and a broken line to represent Yin. This simple representation enabled properties of energies to be represented, by proportion, using Trigrams (3 lines) and Hexagrams (6 lines, 2x trigrams).
<i>Read from bottom to top in quantity. ie The bottom line is the most significant and lessening
  <l>
  </l> upwards.
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Five Elements
</b> (energy types) were identified as having distinct properties and categorised as Earth,  Metal, Water, Wood and Fire  . A  system of interactive
<b>cycles
</b> ( creative and destructive ) was developed.
<br/>
<br/>
Qi (energy) was observed to have differing qualities based on direction of movement and this was the inspiration behind Feng Shui as an environmental guide. Feng Shui was originally used in the siting and design of Palaces and Temples. It later became commonly adopted. Today, in many parts of Asia it is seen as essential before setting up a business or moving home. The aim is to balance energy flows to benefit inhabitants. 
<br/>
<br/>
The
<b>Eight Directions
</b> (Bagua)  form the basis of the Feng Shui Compass ( Lo Pan ). Eg. Qi (energy) flowing from the south has the qualities of the fire element. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Feng Shui
</b> literally translates as wind and water.
<br/>
Feng (wind) is  energy flowing above the ground.
<br/>
Shui (water) is energy inherent in the ground or all mass.
<br/>
<br/>
The
<b>Lo Pan
</b> magnetic compass, used in assessment, shows a variable  'Heavenly' (Feng) sequence of eight directional energy types, shown as Trigrams, combined with a fixed  'Earthly' (shui) sequence of eight Trigrams to give a Hexagram (8x8=64 possible) combination portent reading. Compass readings can however be as specific as to 2 degrees. Personal Horoscopes are also part of a full assessment.
<br/>
<br/>
Taoist
<b>Classical Feng Shui
</b>, which I describe here, emerged from the Form (landscape topography), Compass (directional) and Flying Star (Planetary movement) Schools.
<br/>

  <ul>
    In summary:
    <li>Wu Qi : Original Source energy >
    </li>
    <li>Tai Qi : Balanced fusion of Yin & Yang energies > (splits into)
    </li>
    <li>Yin : Female energy, -'ve charge &
    </li>
    <li>Yang : Male energy, +'ve charge. >
    </li>
    <li>The 5 Elements : Five general energy types >
    </li>
    <li>The 8 Directions : Eight directional energies >
    </li>
    <li>The 64 Hexagram's : 8x8 interactions, more specific types.
    </li>
    <li>Feng Shui : Environmental interpretation of all the above.

  </ul>

<i> In Scientific language they can be thought of as the four fundamental forces: <b>Gravity, Electromagnetism, Strong Nuclear</b> and <b>Weak Nuclear</b>. The Taoists included a fifth unifying force called <b>'Earth'</b></i>.
<br/>


 A binary system of Trigrams (3 lines) and Hexagrams (6 lines) was used to describe and depict qualities. <i>( solid line=Yang, broken line = Yin)</i>


The use of the '5 Elements'  is real and symbolic. <i>eg. The Element Water is the main energy found in water, but also is the main element in a approximately a fifth of everything (the planet Mercury and the Kidney organs for instance)</i> 
<br/>
Each Element describes its own inherent qualities and how it interacts with the others. <i>eg. Wood feeds Fire (this would be a 'creative' exchange), whereas, Water douses Fire (this would be a controlling/destructive exchange).</i>
<br/>
Proportion is obviously a factor. <i>eg. one cup of water won't extinguish a bonfire.</i>
<br/>
<br/>
Two <b>'5 Element Cycles'</b> express generative and controlling exchanges. 
<br/>
<br/>
Energy has different qualities based on direction <i>(eg. energy coming from the south has the property of Fire) </i>and so a system called <b>The 8 Directions</b> (Bagua) was devised to describe energy types based on Compass orientation. <i>[ these are the same 5 Elements with three additional distinct flavors. ( small Earth, small Wood & small Metal ) ]</i>

<h2>+ Theory</h2>
<h3>Wu Qi</h3>
	<p>   
   WuQi is "nothingness". The original source from which the cosmos was born and reborn.
   It is a unity, a single thing, not of the physical universe.
   <br/>
   A, currently scientifically un-explainable, force that animates living things. Much more than spirit, the ultimate life force.
   <br/>
   Scientists are aware of the existance, but know nothing of, <b>Dark Matter</b>.  They estimate it constitutes 90% of everything.  I believe Wu Qi is many levels deeper than
dark matter. <i>[ "from nothing comes something" . Man made physical manifestations come from ideas translated into design and then constructed. "As above, so below" ]</i> 
   <br/>
[ The best way to think of it is as the spark of animating life that enters a new being at the point of conception. ]
   <br/>
   Everything in the spiritual realm is a unity.
   <br/>
Everything on the physical plane is a duality.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Yin & Yang</h3>
	  <p>
Yin and Yang are the two opposing and complimentary energies that together form the basis of everything present in our perceived world. ( yang= solid line, yin=broken line )
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <b>Yang</b> (symbolised by a solid line) is the male principle or +'ve charge and
	    <br/>
	    <b>Yin</b> (symbolised by a broken line) is the female principle or -'ve charge.
<br/>
The proportion, quality and interactions of these two forces give rise to all varied physical manifestations.
Yin and Yang balanced and in harmony is called <b>'Tai Qi'</b>. The proportion of yin and yang in perfect (imperfect) harmony is 1: 1.61803. <i>[ Which is also the proportion of 'Phi' and the 'Golden Section' ]</i>

	    The trigrams and hexagrams are made up of three and six lines respectively. The illustrate the qualities of energy in proportion of of yin/yang ( +'ve, -'ve charge ).

	<h2>The 5 Elements</h2>
	<div class="column1">
	  <p>
The 5 Elements describe the main types of energy in the physical world. Everything in the physical world (visible or invisible - including air, electromagnetic fields etc.) has the overall characteristic of one of the Elements.

Understanding their qualities and the way they interact helps us to implement Feng Shui as well as diagose "well being" in Acupuncture.
