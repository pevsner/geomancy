Taoism is a name, for a way of being not a religion (see the quote opposite).

It is thought to originate from the actions and writings (under duress) of  Lao Tzu. 
The classic Taoist text the "Tao Te Ching" written by Lao Tzu, sometime between 6 BC and 3 BC, is poetic in style but sublimely concise, containing many layers of detailed insight. Lao Tzus' later work, the " Hua Hua Ching", contains more specific information on energetic interactions. (see reading list for details).

Lao Tzu realised that everything was connected, the planets, the elements and all the living things. He deduced that there were common elemental forces and attributes that link everything in the cosmos.

By connecting to these forces through Meditation and Taoist practices (such as Qi Gong, Tai Qi Chuan and Internal Alchemy) one is able to increase physical and subtle energy levels and build a strong platform for spiritual development. Simplistically it is like connecting the positive (heaven) and negative (earth) electric leads to give power.
