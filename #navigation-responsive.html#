  /* Nb. Terms hence refered to:

Geomancy is the reading of energetic interactions on earth and how they affect us. (geo=earth, mancy=divination or reading).
  <br/>
  <br/>

Most ancient cultures (Aboriginal, African, American Indian, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Indian, Nordic, Mayan etc.) have their own systems of explanation.
  <br/>
  <br/>

Feng Shui, the Chinese Taoist form of Geomancy, provides one of the most comprehensive and well documented explanations.
It is a very logical and methodical system once the fundementals are grasped.
There's no magic/faith involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
 
Don't fictionalise your experience or try to imagine something is present when it's not because you want it to be so.
If you can't feel the energies, you are not feeling the energies. Either, give up, leave it for a bit and come back, or just work at
it more. The mind directs and the energy will follow. 
Geomancy is the reading of energetic interactions on earth and how they affect us. (geo=earth, mancy=divination or reading).
  <br/>
  <br/>

Most ancient cultures had systems, some more sophisticated than others, and a few make some sense today.
/*Aboriginal, African, Indian, Mayan, Egyptian, Norse, Native N. American and the Chinese, etc. */

  <br/>
  <br/>
The Chinese type, Feng Shui, is the most comprehensive and well documented.

/* FOOTNOTE
Everything is connected, the planets, the elements and all the living things. What we experience externally reflects our internal universe. Hence our environment is a reflection of ourselves and vice versa. Balancing the external environment has a direct effect upon our internal condition and helps us to realize our potential. */
